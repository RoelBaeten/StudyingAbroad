<h2><a href="#" title=""> Universities </a></h2>
<p>Universities in Germany offer plenty of choice, including some of the most prestigious institutions in Western Europe. Beyond that, every major German city you can think of has at least one university ranked among the world’s best. A total of 14 German universities make the world’s top 250, and 32 are included within the world’s top 500. This establishes Germany well within the world’s higher education elite. </p>
<p>In addition to world-class universities, Germany also offers high quality of life, relatively low tuition fees, extensive support and scholarship schemes for international students, and decent post-graduation employment prospects. So, it’s easy to see why so many choose to study in Germany each year.</p>

<h2><a href="#" title="">Costs</a></h2>
<p>If you want to study in Germany at undergraduate level, great news! There are no tuition fees at public universities in Germany for undergraduate students, and this includes domestic, EU and international students in all states, with the exception of Baden-Württemberg, where non-EU students will need to pay tuition fees of €1,500 (~US$1,670) per semester from autumn 2017.</p>
<p>If you want to study in Germany at master’s level, you may need to pay tuition fees. This is usually only the case for students who have not completed a related bachelor’s program at a university in Germany within the past few years – classed as “non-consecutive” students. Fees for non-consecutive master’s degrees vary, but can amount to as much as €10,000 (~US$11,100) per semester.</p>

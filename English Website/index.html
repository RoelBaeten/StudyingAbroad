<p>Studying in a different country can be scary at first but aslong as you plan correctly and keep yourself to a few guidelines your trip & study will go a lot smoother! That's why we made a small list of tips for when you go study abroad:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a signed, valid passport and visas, if required. Also, before you go, fill in the emergency information page of your passport!
</li>
<li>Make sure you have insurance that will cover your emergency medical needs (including medical evacuation) while you are abroad.</li>
<li>Do your research! If you are planning to go to a non english speaking country try to learn some of the countries basic language. This will greatly help you in your studies and making new contacts while you are there.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with local laws and customs of the countries to which you are traveling. Remember, while in a foreign country, you are subject to its laws!</li>
<li>And most importantly enjoy yourself! This might be the only time you'll be in that specifc country so make sure to set aside some free time to go sightseeing or go shopping with friends.</li>
</ul>

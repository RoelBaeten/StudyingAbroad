<p>The world’s leading study destination for international students, the US boasts over 150 leading universities. Of course, it’s not just the high standard of US universities that attracts students from far and wide. Whether you’re attracted to the bright lights and fast pace of the big city or to miles of unspoiled wilderness; sun-kissed beaches or vast mountain ranges; the rustic and traditional or the sleek and modern, this huge and incredibly varied country has something for everyone.</p>

<h2><a href="#" title=""> Universities </a></h2>
<p>Undergraduate degrees at US universities typically take four years to complete. The first part of the degree is usually spent studying a wide range of subjects – some required and some electives – after which students choose the subject or subjects on which they want to focus – known as “major(s)”.</p>
<p>You may also earn a “minor” qualification alongside your major by completing classes in an additional field. This is often used to supplement the major degree. For example, business majors often minor in economics, while liberal arts majors may minor in philosophy. Some students also choose minors simply to explore a field they’re interested in, even if it does not closely relate to their major.</p>

<h2><a href="#" title="">Costs</a></h2>
<p>In terms of fees, US universities do not tend to differentiate between domestic and international students. Public universities charge lower fees for students from within the same state compared to everyone else, while private universities usually have one set fee for everyone. To give you an example, the highest-ranked university in both the world and the US, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has set its tuition fees at $49,580 per year for all undergraduate and most graduate programs in the 2017/18 academic year.</p>

<p>Hosting over 500,000 international students, the UK is the world’s second leading study destination (after the US), largely thanks to the strong global reputation of UK universities.</p>

<h2><a href="#" title=""> Universities </a></h2>
<p>Higher education in the UK varies in each constituent state (England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland), though the systems are fairly similar. Undergraduate degrees at universities in the UK typically last three years.</p>
<p>Students in the UK start their higher education with a bachelor’s degree, although for some subjects you can enroll on an undergraduate degree that leads directly into a master’s program – these combined courses are four years long. Taken separately, master’s programs last one or two years, and PhDs at least three. Courses are taught in English at most universities in the UK, with some Welsh-language programs offered in Wales and Scottish Gaelic-language programs in Scotland.</p>

<h2><a href="#" title="">Costs</a></h2>
<p>The level of UK tuition fees varies depending on your home country. EU students are charged the same as students from within the UK, while those from outside the EU typically face higher fees. In England, universities can charge up to £9,250 (~US$11,330) per year at undergraduate level.</p>
<p>International students from outside the EU can expect significantly higher tuition fees, varying between about £7,000 (~US$8,580) and £35,000 (~US$42,900) per year depending on the course. At postgraduate level, there’s no set maximum amount, and for all students (UK/EU/international), tuition fees tend to be higher than at undergraduate level. Again, this varies depending on the degree and university.</p>
